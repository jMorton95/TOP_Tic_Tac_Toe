# TOP_Tic_Tac_Toe
Tic Tac Toe Project from The Odin Project Cirriculum.

The Main Objective of this program is to display mastership over JavaScript Object Factory Functions and Module Patterns by creating a playable game of Tic Tac Toe that uses as little Global Scope Code as possible.

Each function needs to to take advantage of Public and Private scopes to keep code organised and to only expose code that is necessary to be exposed, ensuring a safe product that can easily be refactored and understood by logically organising functionality.

Players should be able to enter their own names for a personalised look and the game board needs to be professionally styled with responsive animation and style effects to give a rewarding feel to the program.

An AI Mode can finally be added so a player can play against the computer (optional difficulty modes to be added).

Key Takeaways from this Project:  
-- Fully understanding and implementing dynamic and responsive Flexbox layouts.  
-- Taking advantage of Scopes and Closures to keep my functions self-contained and protected.  
-- Implementing an in-depth algorithm for state checking/updating. (To Be revisited later when my JavaScript skills are stronger)
